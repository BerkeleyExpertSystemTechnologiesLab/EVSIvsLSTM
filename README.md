Repo for paper "Dynamic Placement of Rapidly Deployable Mobile Sensor Robots Using Machine Learning and Expected Value of Information"

# Notes
- I probably still left some absolute path in the project. When running a script, please check the paths used for loading dataset, saving models and etc.

# Repo Structure
The section contains the structure graph of this project and some simple descriptions of folders
- For more detailed description of each script, please refer to the README inside each folder.

- Every item with `.` extension is a file/script. Items without `.` extension are folders.

- Folders like `dataset`, `models`, `backup` are not actually empty. But because they usually hold fairly large files/datasets I decided to not upload the content directly to github (`.gitignore` are left in those folders as placeholders). Please contact me directly if you need those files.
