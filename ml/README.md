1.  For the training set, there are 500 simulations in total, where each simulation is roughly the same. During each simulation, samples will be taken at a constant rate. There will be 500 samples of each type of fault. So there will be 500*21 = 10500 data points for each simulation.

2. There are 500 simulations, so the total # of data points = 5250000.
3. Faults are usually introduced after a few hours of normal operation, and that's why the first 500 samples are always fault type 0
